# Java Exercises and Projects by Reivosar

This repository contains a collection of Java exercises and practical projects designed to illustrate various Java programming concepts and utilities. It leverages Java 21 to implement modern Java features and practices.

## Features

- **Promise**: An implementation similar to JavaScript's Promise, providing an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
- **EventPublisher**: A utility for asynchronous event publishing, allowing for decoupled event-driven programming.
- **Cache**: A thread-safe caching mechanism, enabling efficient data retrieval and storage.
- **PDF Creator**: Utilizes Java to generate PDF documents, demonstrating Java's capability to interact with document formats.
